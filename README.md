# Credit Scoring Project

A machine learning-based project for evaluating credit risk and predicting the creditworthiness of loan applicants. This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of credit scoring using data analysis, feature engineering, and model building.

---

## Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understands and visualizes the dataset for patterns and insights.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and scales features.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creates new features to improve model performance.
- **Model Building:** Implements and compares machine learning algorithms for credit scoring.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Uses accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC-AUC, and other metrics to assess model performance.
- **Interpretability:** Analyzes feature importance to understand model decisions.
